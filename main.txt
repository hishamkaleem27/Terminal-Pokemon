to the mystical land of Saffron City. My name is Dan, and I am beyond honored to be your guide throughout your journey through Saffron City. 
That being said, I must say this as blatantly as possible: Your journey will be difficult. There will be several times throughout your 
journey that you will feel the urge to give up. However, I advise you to lift your head and continue with confidence as I can assure you 
that your journey will be rewarding at the least. You and your team of Pokemon will fight the Dojo Masters in the five regions of Saffron City.
After defeating each master, you will have the oppurtunity to capture one of their Pokemon's and continue to the next dojo. The 
dojo masters become progressively harder to defeat, but if you happen to defeat all five dojo masters, you will be granted access to the 
metaverse where you will have the oppurtunity to meet some of the most powerful and renowned trainers in existence. 
Oh, I almost forgot! 
Take one of these Pokemons to get you started on your journey!
Please select one of the following Pokemons (Enter name as displayed above):
, a formidable Pokemon. Excellent choice! Now, your journey begins. Your first battle will be against the master of the Delta Dojo. I wish you nothing but success!
